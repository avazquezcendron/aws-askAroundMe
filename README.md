# Ask Around Me - Get your questions answered by local users

This example application shows how to build a serverless web application including features like authentication, geohashing and realtime messaging.

To learn more about how this application works, see the 3-part series on the AWS Compute Blog:
- Part 1: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-a-location-based-scalable-serverless-web-app-part-1/.
- Part 2: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-a-location-based-scalable-serverless-web-app-part-2/.
- Part 3: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-a-location-based-scalable-serverless-web-app-part-3/.

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details.

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [AWS SAM CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) - minimum version 0.48.
* [NodeJS 12.x installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Vue.js and Vue CLI installed](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html)
* [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
* Sign up for an [Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/)

## Installation Instructions

1. [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and login.

2. Clone the repo onto your local development machine using `git clone`.

### Installing the realtime stack

1. From the command line, install the realtime messaging stack:
```
cd backend
sam deploy --guided --template-file realtime.yaml
```
During the prompts, enter `askAroundMe-realtime` for the Stack Name, enter your preferred Region, and accept the defaults for the remaining questions. 

2. Retrieve the IoT endpointAddress - note this for the frontend installation:
```
aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS
```
3. Retrieve the Cognito Pool ID - note this for the frontend installation:
```
aws cognito-identity list-identity-pools --max-results 10
```

### Installing the DynamoDB geohash library

1. From the command line, setup the dynamodb-geo library and DynamoDB table:
```
cd setup
npm install
node ./setup.js <<REGION>>
```
Replace `<<REGION>>` with your preferred AWS Region (e.g. us-east-1)

This process takes up to 1 minute to complete. 

2. After this, retrieve the DynamoDB StreamArn value for the next part of the installation, using the following command:
```
aws dynamodbstreams list-streams --table-name aamQuestions
```

### Installing the backend application

From the command line, deploy the SAM template. Note that your SAM version must be at least 0.48 - if you receive build errors, it is likely that your SAM CLI version is not up to date. 
Run:

```
cd .. 
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

When prompted for parameters, enter:
- Stack Name: askAroundMe-backend
- AWS Region: your preferred AWS Region (e.g. us-east-1)
- QuestionsTableName: leave as default
- QuestionsTableStreamARN: enter the stream ARN you noted in the last section. 
- AnswersTableName: leave as default
- IoTDataEndpoint: the IoT endpointAddress noted in the realtime stack installation.
- Auth0issuer: this is the URL for the Auth0 account (the format is https://dev-abc12345.auth0.com/).
- Accept all other defaults.

This takes several minutes to deploy. At the end of the deployment, note the `APIendpoint` value, as you need this in the frontend installation.

### Installing the frontend application

The frontend code is saved in the `frontend` subdirectory. 

1. Before running, you need to set environment variables in the `src\main.js` file:

- GoogleMapsKey: [sign up](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) for a Google Maps API key and enter the value here.
- APIurl: this is the `APIendpoint` value from the last section.
- PoolId: your Cognito pool ID from earlier.
- Host: your IoT endpoint from earlier.
- Region: your preferred AWS Region (e.g. us-east-1).

2. Open the `frontend\auth_config.json` and enter the values from your Auth0 account:
- domain: this is your account identifier, in the format `dev-12345678.auth0.com`.
- clientId: a unique string identifying the client application.
- audience: set to https://auth0-jwt-authorizer.

3. Change directory into the frontend code, and run the NPM installation:

```
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
4. After installation is complete, you can run the application locally:

```
npm run build
```
